# Image-Classification-with-Transfer-Learning-VGG16-
Here, I implemented VGG-16 transfer learning CNN architecture to classify Cats and Dogs images in a large dataset using ImageNet, which has more than 20,000 data classes. I write the code on Google Colab and uploaded the dataset of 2000 images in google drive.
